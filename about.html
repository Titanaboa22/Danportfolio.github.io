       Hi my name's Dansel Piamonte a 21 years old amateur web designer as well
       as a graphic designer with just a year of experience , my passion began
       3years ago in 2018<br>during that time i moved from Sicayab national highschool
       to Andres Bonifacio College, taking TVL-ICT as a Senior Highschool(2018-2022).(it was
       one of the best school)<br>,i was
       inspired by my surroundings and it compels me to do better, So now I am striving to be
       a better web dev to make myself happy.<br>
